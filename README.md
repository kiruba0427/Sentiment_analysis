## 🌟 **Overview**  

🔍 **Goal**: Develop a robust sentiment analysis model to classify text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.  
💡 **Approach**:  
1. Clean and preprocess raw textual data.  
2. Train and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification.  
3. Deploy the model in Huggingface space for real-world usage.

## 🎯 **Objective**  

1️⃣ Preprocess textual data for better model performance.  
2️⃣ Transform text using advanced vectorization techniques like **tokenization**.  
3️⃣ Train and evaluate machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification.  
4️⃣ Deploy an interactive application for real-time sentiment predictions.  

---

## 🛠️ **Data Preprocessing Steps**  

**1️⃣ Text Cleaning**:  
- Removed HTML tags, URLs, and special characters.  
- Tokenized text using `nltk`.  
- Lowercased and lemmatized words for consistency.  

**2️⃣ Feature Extraction**:  
- Applied **Vectorization** to represent text numerically.

## 🏋️‍♂️ **Training Process**  

 Split data into **Train (80%)** and **Test (20%)** sets.  
 Evaluated models using cross-validation with metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score**.  

## 🌐 **Deployment**  

🌟 **Interactive Web Application**:  
Deployed the sentiment analysis model using **gradio**.  
**Features**:  
1. Upload input sentences directly.  
2. Real-time sentiment predictions.  

## 🚀 **Conclusion and Future Work**  

✅ **Conclusion**:  
- Successfully built and deployed a sentiment analysis pre trained model with 90% accuracy.  
- Demonstrated the application in real-world scenarios using a user-friendly interface.  

🔮 **Future Improvements**:  
- Explore **Deep Learning** techniques like **BERT**.  
- Handle sarcasm and contextual nuances in text.  
- Expand the dataset for better generalization.
